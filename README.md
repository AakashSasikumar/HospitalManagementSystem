Our mandatory DBMS assignment

There are two parts
- The website
- The Desktop Application

This repo consists of only the desktop application. It was made using JavaFX.

### Disclaimer
Due to the acute time frame given to us, I wasn't able to figure out how to make the GUI with FXML, I ended up using just Java.
